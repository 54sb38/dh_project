# dh_project
Thesis project of my master's degree at the University of Queensland. I discover using digital human technology in assisting users to better maintain their exercise habit.

I am developing (by March 2024) the testbed prototype for this project using Unity. The prototype involves a digital human coach with a dialogue system and UI.
